***** TestCase Structure *****
1. Run workload to create the tables (backup_dir[x])
2. Optional: Run workload to alter/insert the tables created in step1 [dirty_dir[x] ] 
3. Full Backup
4. Restore
5. Validate restore [restore_dir]
6. Validate table data
7. Verify ao, co table tuple count

*** How to add a new test : All three steps should be added***
1. Add the new table in the existing backup_dir or create new directory containing required tables
2. All a validation sql in restore_dir to validate the metadata of the table after restore
3. SQL to verify ao, co tuple count

*** Adding sql files in a new version ***

Since the sql runs are not using any of the tincrepo models like SQLTestCase, it doesn't support the metadata to pass in the versions.
We have to explicitly differentiate them in the 'run_sqlfiles' function.
For eg: The tests that can only run on 4.3  need to have a name with '4_3' in it and add a line in the funciton like
if '4.2' in version and '4_3' in file:
    continue

Or else:
Create new test_methods with appropriate @gpdb_version
