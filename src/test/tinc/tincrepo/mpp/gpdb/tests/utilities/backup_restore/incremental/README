***** TestCase Structure *****
1. Run workload to create the tables [backup_dir]
2. Full Backup
3. Run workload to alter/insert the tables created in step1 [dirty_dir[x] ] 
4. Run Incremental Backup
5. Step 3 and 4 could be repeatd with differnt dirty_dir[x]
6. Restore
7. Validate restore [restore_dir]

*** Pre-Requisites for the test to work ***
1. One dirty_table_list file in each of the dirty_dir with all the tables thats being modified in the directory 
        :format [schema_name: table_name/ schema_name:partition_name ]


*** How to add a new test : All three steps should be added***
1. Add the new table in backup_dir
2. Alter/insert to the table should be added in one of the dirty_dir  + tablename in dirty_table_list
3. All a validation sql in restore_dir to validate the metadata of the table after restore

*** Adding sql files in a new version ***

Since the sql runs are not using any of the tincrepo models like SQLTestCase, it doesn't support the metadata to pass in the versions.
We have to explicitly differentiate them in the 'run_sqlfiles' function.
For eg: The tests that can only run on 4.3  need to have a name with '4_3' in it and add a line in the funciton like
if '4.2' in version and '4_3' in file:
    continue

Or else:
Create new test_methods with appropriate @gpdb_version
